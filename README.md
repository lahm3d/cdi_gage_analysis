# Leveraging USGS Streamgage Data to Map Flood-prone Areas

### Summary:

We will develop reproducible workflows in R and Python to combine already existing and underutilized field data collected as part of the USGS streamgage network with remotely sensed data to map flood-prone areas for various recurrence intervals in both gaged and ungaged stream reaches.
